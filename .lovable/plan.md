# Sorry Mom & Co — Website Build Plan

## Brand & Design System
- **Color palette**: Dark neutrals (charcoal/near-black backgrounds, warm whites) with the pine green from your logo as the primary accent color
- **Typography**: Bold serif for headlines (editorial feel), clean sans-serif for body text
- **Style**: High whitespace, editorial layout, luxury-with-edge aesthetic — think fashion magazine meets travel editorial
- **Logo**: Your uploaded pine green wordmark will be used throughout
- **Imagery**: Placeholder images styled to suggest high-end lifestyle/travel photography
